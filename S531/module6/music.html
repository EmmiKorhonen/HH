            <h2>Metal music</h2>

            As one may suspect, since I live in a country that has 42.61 heavy metal bands per 100,000 resident, my favourite music genre is metal. When I first discovered love for
            heavyer music, I was only 6 years old. I was watching Eurovision Song Contest with my family, when I first saw Finland's representative Lordi perform. I remember sitting
            on the floor hugging my knees and watching how Mr. Lordi spread his wings while growling. From that moment forward my music taste has been heavily leaning towards rock
            and metal music and when time past, I always seeked more heavier sounding bands.
            <br>
            <br>
            Metal music gives me energy and helps me cope with dark times and hard feelings. Best thing about rock and metal genres is that it can explore so many different sounds!
            For example one of my favourite folk metal bands is Mongolian The Hu who use traditional Mongolian instruments and throat singing in their music.

            <h2>My instruments</h2><br>I've never played anything with seriousness, but I have a background of trying to learn several instruments. My first instrument was a recorder
            that everyone had to learn to play a little bit in elementary school. Even though I don't fancy the sound of recorder, I picked it up quickly and in high school I used to
            play songs from Nightwish when I was bored.
            <br>
            <br>When I reached third grade I was in class that specialised in music. First I started with guitar classes, but I got bored of it pretty soon. Then I picked up clarinet
            that I would have loved, but the teacher yelled at me so loudly when I accidentally pressed something while trying to detach parts of my clarinet, so I never went back to those
            classes. Then finally our school found drum teacher and I ended up playing the drums for 8 years in conservatorium.
            <br>
            <br> After not playing anything in years, I really wanted to get to play something simple out of boredom. However my partner banned the recorder from me since he really
            hated the sound more than I did so I ended up getting a tin whistle which pretty much fills the void. All though I've been thinking of learning to play a bass, but luckly
            for neighbors, it would be too expencive for me to get at this point.
