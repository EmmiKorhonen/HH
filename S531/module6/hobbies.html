            <h2>Taekwondo:</h2><img src="kuva2.jpg" alt="Emmi Korhonen doing high side kick outside."> I've been doing taekwondo actively since 2016. I had originally started on childrens basics
             -course when I was in elementary school, but had to drop it soon due to a slight injury. When my friend got interested about taekwodno years later, I decided to go to basics 
             -course with
            her and so began my taekwondo journey.
            <br>
            <br>
            Taekwondo soon became a huge part of my character. I went to practises about 5 times a week and made friends along the way. I started to volunteer on different events and began
            helping with childrens group when I was barelly a yellow belt. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When I was on my green belt I started as an instructor for adults basics course. By the time I had reached my
            blue belt I started at our taekwondo clubs board as secretary and later in life I had obtained myself a duties of vice president and managed for exmaple clubs social media, 
            addvertising, web site maintanance etc. In 2023 I finally got my first degree black belt.

            <h2>Other hobbies:</h2>I'm not good at many things, but I still like many things. I really enjoy aerial yoga and wish to graduate as soon as possible in order to eraning
            money for continuing this hobby.

            I have found a joy of reading once again! I really love good stories and that's why I'm driven towards video
            games that are more based on the story rather than just doing pointless stuff like shooting without any context. Boardgames with good theme are always my favourites and I 
            hope I could play them with a group of people.

            I've just started to teach myself how to chroset, since I love the idea of being able to create simple amigurumis
